Your time is limited. By the time you finish this sentence, someone will visit and abandon your<br>
website. Unless you give your visitors a reason to stick around, they're gone. High bounce rate is an<br>
indicator of visitors' lack of interest.

<h2>Here are some of the most common problems in website design:</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li> <b>There's no clear path</b>. You want to extend a warm welcome to your visitors. Give them an<br>
easy way in and through. Too much competition for attention is a turn off. When you<br>
provide too many options, the functional result is no options.<br>
<li> <b>Outdated design</b>. Your site was state of the art in 2009. It's got a header, a couple of<br>
sidebars, and a big chunk of information running down the center. Guess what? It looks like
<br>it's nearly a decade old. Because it is. Time to refresh with current design thinking. The<br>
layout of a page has evolved over the past decade. These days the best sites break up content<br>
into smaller, digestible bits.
<li>.<b> Overused stock images and icons</b>. If visitors see the same image on multiple sites, it erodes<br>
trust. That picture of people sitting around the conference table? They sure get around to a<br>
lot of offices!
<li> <b>Too many textures and colors.</b> You are trying to add interest, but you just add clutter. Limit<br>
colors and fonts. Maintain a thematic color scheme. For professional sites, try to limit the<br>
variety of fonts to three or fewer.
